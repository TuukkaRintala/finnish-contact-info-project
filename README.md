# Finnish contact info project
This is a project for the introduction to programming course at Tampere University of Applied Sciences. The aim is to make a program that can read and modify a text file that contains contact information.
# Features
The program supports creating, reading, updating and deleting finnish contact info from JSON files using a command line user interface. The information you can store includes a finnish personal ID number, first name, last name, phone number, address and e-mail and each piece of information is validated when it is stored.
# Installation
Download the code, unzip it and navigate to the /src folder in a terminal and use the command `javac ContactsApp.java`. You must have Java installed.
Now you can run the program from the /src folder in a terminal using the command `java ContactsApp`.
# Code style
I am using the Sun Code Convention.
